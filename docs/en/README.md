## Self-Introduction

**Engineer who continues to grow in both technical skills and leadership**

Through my 2 years and 9 months of experience at DeNA, I have gradually built my career from engineer to Scrum Master, developing both technical and management skills. I have particular experience in payment system design and implementation, having worked with multiple payment services including Amazon Pay, GMO Payment Gateway, and Stripe. I am currently handling a payment system migration project at STORES, Inc.

I also have experience in scalable system development, including system design with eventual consistency in microservice environments and stable operation of high-traffic live streaming applications. I look forward to leveraging these experiences to tackle even greater technical challenges in the future.
